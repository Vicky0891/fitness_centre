## *About "Fitness Centre"* 

The "Fitness centre" application was created to enable a simple and quick purchase of a subscription.

Any user can see available subscriptions and general information about the center and coaches.

The user can register in the system, place an order and gain access to the personal account. In his personal account, he can upload a photo for his profile, personal information, and view his order history.

Each client receives a personal appointment from a personal trainer, which he can change at his discretion.
Depending on its type (new, permanent or corporate), the client may receive additional discounts on the order.

The trainer in this system has access to the list of his clients to whom he makes an appointment.

The system administrator has access to all general information, and can also change order statuses, client type, their role, delete them from the system, and assign a trainer for a specific client.
